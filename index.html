	<H3>About Me</H3>
	<p> I'm a personable, adventurous, happy-go-lucky future web developer. I enjoy spending time with family, watching korean drams online, and trying new things. I'd rather be challenged than bored. A graduate of Scripps College, I recieved a bachelors degree in International Relations and Politics. Upon graduation, I taught English Abroad in South Korea. Bilingual in Korean and English, I am hoping to master a few programming languages as well. Now that I am back in the U.S., I plan to attend a coding academy and pursue a career in web development.</p>
